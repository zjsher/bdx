# PreToolUse hook: block `bd close` in Bash tool calls so the agent is forced
# to go through /bdx:close (which runs /bdx:summarize first, then closes the
# bd issue with a resolution). Summaries otherwise get skipped and history
# is lost.
#
# Bypass: include `BDX_ALLOW_BARE_BD_CLOSE=1` as an inline env assignment
# in the bash command itself — e.g. `BDX_ALLOW_BARE_BD_CLOSE=1 bd close bd-xxx`.
# The hook inspects the command string (not its own env) so this works when
# /bdx:close drives the close, and for rare manual overrides.

Blocked: do not call `bd close` directly.

Run `/bdx:close <bd-id>` instead — it writes a summary via /bdx:summarize
(recording what was built + decisions + links), then closes the bd issue
with a resolution message. Without the summary, task history is lost.

For abandoned work: `/bdx:close <bd-id> abandoned because <reason>` still
closes, it just records the abandonment rationale.

Escape hatch (rare): prefix the close command with the bypass env var,
e.g.  `BDX_ALLOW_BARE_BD_CLOSE=1 bd close bd-xxx`
