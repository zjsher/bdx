  Open a new bd task with a paired plan file at $AGENT_HOME/plan/. Use for non-trivial work that warrants a written-down approach (multi-step, cross-cutting, or you'll need to re-enter cold). Skip for one-line fixes (just `bd create` + a body) or when the bd already exists (use scope instead). Predecessor: triage (or none, for fresh ideas). Successor: attach.

## Codex host execution (mandatory)

When the harness is Codex, invoke every shell tool call that runs `bd` with `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"`; for a direct `bd ...` command, also set `prefix_rule: ["bd"]`. The installed allow rule only pre-approves escalation—it does not move a default call outside the workspace sandbox. This applies to read-only commands too. If a sandboxed call reports a Dolt connection failure, retry at host level before diagnosing Dolt as down; wrappers inherit the sandbox. Claude Code and other non-Codex harnesses must ignore this section and use their normal execution path.

Open a new beads task and write the paired plan file to `$AGENT_HOME/plan/` — the plan doubles as the execution prompt for a future `attach`. bd holds state (status, deps, labels), the plan holds narrative (goal, scope, checkboxes, decisions). This skill is the only way a plan enters the system; do not write plan files ad-hoc elsewhere.

**Trigger**: starting non-trivial work that needs a written plan you'll execute later or hand off. **Skip** if (a) the work is trivial enough that a `bd create -t task "<title>"` body is the whole record, or (b) the bd already exists from triage / quick capture (use `scope` to retrofit it instead).

## What this skill does (in order)

1. Draft a short title and kebab-case slug from the conversation or `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. Derive labels (see Labels section below).
3. Create the beads issue: `bd create "<title>" -t task -p <0-3> -l <project> [-l <component> ...]` and capture the returned `bd-xxx` ID.
4. If a parent was specified (see Parent section), link it: `bd dep add bd-xxx <parent-id> -t parent-child`.
5. Resolve the parent for frontmatter: `bd dep list bd-xxx --direction=down --type parent-child --json` → first `id` (or null).
6. Write the plan to `$AGENT_HOME/plan/bd-xxx-<slug>.md` (see template below) with `parent:` populated.
7. Cross-link: `bd update bd-xxx -d "plan: $AGENT_HOME/plan/bd-xxx-<slug>.md"` so the beads issue points at the plan.
8. Report the bd-id, labels, parent (if any), and path back to the user in one line.

## Labels

Every issue gets a **project label** (required) and zero or more **component labels** (optional). The primary label is always the repo name so `bd list -l <repo>` gives the unified per-project queue.

### Project label (required)

Auto-derive from the git root:

```
basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"
```

- If the command succeeds, cross-check the result against the manifest. Match against **H2 slug first, then `aliases:` entries** for each project. If either matches, use the canonical slug (the H2) as the label. If neither matches, warn the user: "This repo isn't in the manifest — add an entry, add this name as an alias, or confirm the label." Use the derived name on confirmation.
- If the command fails (not in a git repo, e.g. working from `~/.claude` or a sandbox), read `$AGENT_HOME/manifest.md`, present the known project slugs as a numbered list, and ask the user to pick one. Do not guess.
- The user may refer to a project by any alias during conversation; always resolve to the canonical slug before passing to `bd -l`.

### Component labels (optional)

Only add when the task is clearly scoped to a subcomponent of a larger repo (monorepo case). The authoritative list of valid component labels for a given project lives in `$AGENT_HOME/manifest.md` under that project's `components:` field. Only apply components that are declared in the manifest for this project — do not invent new component names.

Derive from:

- Paths mentioned in the conversation that match a manifest component's path (e.g. plan touches `apps/ui/*` and the manifest declares `ui — apps/ui/` → label `ui`)
- Explicit user cue ("this is an API task") mapped against declared components
- `$ARGUMENTS` if the user passed a component name — validate against the manifest

If the scope is cross-cutting (touches multiple components), skip component labels — the project label alone suffices.

### Never do this

- Don't create compound labels like `listscrub-ui` — that breaks the cross-repo component queries (`bd list -l ui`).
- Don't add labels speculatively. A label should answer a real query someone would run.

## Parent (optional)

Plans can roll up under a parent bd (epic, umbrella initiative, etc.) so Obsidian Bases can group children by parent. Single-valued — a plan has at most one parent.

**Detect a parent from:**

- `$ARGUMENTS` containing `--parent bd-xxx` or `parent=bd-xxx`
- Explicit conversation cue ("this rolls up under bd-xxx", "child of bd-xxx", "part of the bd-xxx epic")
- Active context: if the user is clearly working inside a parent task (e.g. a plan was just attached for `bd-xxx` and they're filing a sub-task), confirm before linking

If detected, link in bd: `bd dep add <new-id> <parent-id> -t parent-child`. bd is canonical — the frontmatter `parent:` is read from `bd dep list` after the link is set, never written speculatively.

If no parent is detected, leave `parent:` empty (`parent:` with no value, or omit entirely). Don't ask — most plans are root-level.

## Output location

Write to: `$AGENT_HOME/plan/<bd-id>-<slug>.md`

Naming convention:
- **The bd-id prefix is mandatory** — every plan is keyed by its beads issue. One plan per bd-id; grep the bd-id to find every related file in the vault.
- `<slug>`: short, kebab-case, lowercase, no spaces — describes *what's being built* (e.g. `auth-middleware-rewrite`). Derive from `$ARGUMENTS` if provided, otherwise from the conversation topic.
- **No date in the filename.** Unlike summaries/context dumps, there is one plan per bd-id. The bd-id itself is the uniqueness token.
- Create `plan/` if it doesn't exist.
- **Never rename after creation** — Obsidian wikilinks point at the filename. Use Obsidian's rename if truly needed.

## Priority guidance for `bd create -p`

- `-p 0` — urgent / blocking real work
- `-p 1` — important, this week
- `-p 2` — normal backlog (default)
- `-p 3` — someday / nice-to-have

If the user didn't signal urgency, use `-p 2`.

The plan's `rank:` frontmatter is a 0-99 number for fine-grained manual sort in Obsidian (lower = higher priority, matching bd's convention). Seed it from the chosen bd priority using these initial bands, leaving room to nudge within a tier:

| bd `-p` | seed `rank` |
|---|---|
| 0 | 10 |
| 1 | 30 |
| 2 | 50 |
| 3 | 70 |

bd remains canonical for actual priority — `rank:` is a manual override for Obsidian sort and does not auto-sync if `bd update -p` runs later.

## Linking rules (critical for Obsidian graph view)

- **All in-vault references are wikilinks**: `[[note-name]]` or `[[note-name|display]]`. Never use `[text](path.md)` for anything inside `$AGENT_HOME`.
- **Link touched source files as wikilinks** — e.g. `` `[[src/auth/middleware.ts]]` `` (wrap in backticks when it should also render as code in prose).
- **Link concepts** as `[[concept/<idea>]]` so repeated ideas become hub nodes.
- **Link tickets / PRs / related bd issues** as `[[INGEST-482]]`, `[[PR-1234]]`, `[[bd-xxx]]`.
- **Link related vault notes**: `[[summary/<slug>--<date>]]`, `[[context/<label>--<date>-<time>]]`, sibling plans `[[plan/bd-yyy-<slug>]]`.
- **Frontmatter `bd:`** — this is the canonical link back to beads state.
- **Frontmatter `tags:`** — always include `plan` and the project/area.
- External URLs stay as plain markdown links.

## Goal
<1–2 sentences on what we're building and why. Inline-link concepts as [[concept/...]].>

## Context
<what led to this, constraints, tickets like [[INGEST-482]], related notes [[summary/...]] / [[context/...]]>

## Scope

### In scope
- <bullet per outcome, not per task>

### Out of scope
- <explicit non-goals — preempt scope creep>

## Plan

### Phase 1 — <name>
- [ ] <specific, verifiable step> — touches `[[<file-path>]]`
- [ ] ...

### Phase 2 — <name>
- [ ] ...

<Use as many phases as needed. Each checkbox should be verifiable — the agent flips it when done.>

## Key decisions (already made)
- **<decision>** — <rationale>. Decided by: <agent | user | both>. Related: [[concept/<idea>]]
- ...

## Open questions
- <question with the options being weighed, link concepts>
- ...

## Verification
<How we'll know this is done — tests, manual checks, acceptance criteria.>

## Related
- [[bd-yyy]] — <relationship>
- [[summary/<prior-slug>--<date>]]
- [[concept/<hub-idea>]]
```

## Rules

- **The plan is the prompt.** Write it so an agent can pick it up cold and execute — no "see our chat" references. Self-contained.
- **Checkboxes are verifiable steps, not vibes.** "Refactor auth" is not a checkbox. "Extract `requireAuth` middleware into `src/auth/middleware.ts`" is.
- **Capture decisions already made, separately from open questions.** Future-you needs to distinguish "settled" from "pending."
- **Don't bloat.** A plan is a handoff, not a design doc. If a section is empty, omit it — don't leave stub "TBD" lines.
- **Every cross-reference is a wikilink.** If you catch yourself writing `[text](path.md)` for a vault note, convert it.
- **One plan per bd-id.** If the task's shape has fundamentally changed, close the old bd and `plan` a new one rather than rewriting history.
- **`private: false` by default.** Flip to `true` for side-project/personal plans that shouldn't sync to teammates. The sync layer (not this skill) honors the flag — the skill just writes it.

## Process

1. `mkdir -p "$AGENT_HOME/plan"`.
2. Derive title + slug from `$ARGUMENTS` or conversation.
3. Derive labels: project from `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"`; ask if not in a repo. Derive any component labels from conversation/paths.
4. Detect parent (see Parent section). If specified, validate the parent bd exists (`bd show <parent-id>` succeeds) before proceeding.
5. `bd create "<title>" -t task -p <0-3> -l <project> [-l <component> ...]` — capture `bd-xxx` from output.
6. If a parent was detected: `bd dep add bd-xxx <parent-id> -t parent-child`.
7. Resolve parent for frontmatter: `bd dep list bd-xxx --direction=down --type parent-child --json` and take the first `id` (or empty if none).
8. Resolve the harness-qualified bdx session identity: prefer `$BDX_SESSION_ID`; otherwise use the exact `bdx-session-id` value injected by the `SessionStart` hook; otherwise, for backward compatibility, prefix a non-empty `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` as `claude-code:<id>`. If none is available (for example, a host without hooks), set `sessions: []` and continue.
9. Write `$AGENT_HOME/plan/bd-xxx-<slug>.md` using the template above. Include `kind: agent-note`, the resolved bdx session identity in `sessions:` as a quoted string, the labels in `tags:`, the resolved parent in `parent:` (empty if none), and seed `rank:` from the chosen `-p` value using the tier table above (p0→10, p1→30, p2→50, p3→70).
10. `bd update bd-xxx -d "plan: $AGENT_HOME/plan/bd-xxx-<slug>.md"` to cross-link.
11. Report the bd-id, labels, parent (if any), and absolute plan path back to the user in one line.

## Resuming

The `sessions:` frontmatter lists every harness-qualified session that touched the artifact, newest last. Resume `claude-code:<id>` with `claude --resume <id>` and `codex:<id>` with `codex resume <id>`; use the named harness's resume command for other prefixes.
