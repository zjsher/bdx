description: Apply plain labels or namespaced external refs (jira:..., linear:..., gh:..., figma:...) to a bd issue, and propagate namespaced refs into the linked plan's frontmatter + Obsidian wikilinks. Use to wire a bd into outside-world tracking (Jira ticket, GitHub issue, Figma file) or to add ad-hoc tags. Skip for project/component labels (those belong on plan/scope at task creation, not after) and for parent-child relationships (use `bd dep add <child> <parent> -t parent-child` directly so frontmatter re-derives correctly). Contexts/summaries are left as historical snapshots.

## Codex host execution (mandatory)

When the harness is Codex, invoke every shell tool call that runs `bd` with `sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"`; for a direct `bd ...` command, also set `prefix_rule: ["bd"]`. The installed allow rule only pre-approves escalation—it does not move a default call outside the workspace sandbox. This applies to read-only commands too. If a sandboxed call reports a Dolt connection failure, retry at host level before diagnosing Dolt as down; wrappers inherit the sandbox. Claude Code and other non-Codex harnesses must ignore this section and use their normal execution path.

Add labels or external references to an existing bd issue and sync the plan markdown so Obsidian graph view picks up the links. Supports two kinds of labels:

- **Plain labels** — e.g. `priority-high`, `needs-design`, `blocked-by-legal`. Go on the bd issue only.
- **Namespaced external references** — any label containing `:` is treated as an external ref, e.g. `jira:ZAP-50`, `linear:FOO-123`, `gh:listscrub/platform#412`, `figma:<file-id>`. These go on the bd issue AND into the plan's `external:` frontmatter, plus a wikilink in the plan's Related section for Obsidian graph view.

## What this skill does (in order)

1. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`**: first token is the bd-id; remaining tokens are labels/refs. If the bd-id is missing, ask. If no labels/refs given, ask.
2. **Validate the bd exists**: `bd show <bd-id>`. If missing, abort.
3. **Apply labels to bd**: for each label, `bd label add <bd-id> <label>`. Idempotent — re-adding an existing label is a no-op. Skip silently if already applied.
4. **Split labels**: separate namespaced refs (contain `:`) from plain labels.
5. **If namespaced refs and the bd has a plan**:
   - Locate the plan: `ls $AGENT_HOME/plan/<bd-id>-*.md`.
   - If found, read its frontmatter. Add any new refs to an `external:` list (create the key if missing, dedupe entries).
   - In the plan body, ensure a `## Related` section exists and contains a wikilink per ref. Use the ref's non-namespace portion for the wikilink label: `jira:ZAP-50` → `[[ZAP-50]]`, `gh:listscrub/platform#412` → `[[listscrub#412]]`. Dedupe — don't add a wikilink that's already there.
   - If no plan file exists (task was created without `plan`), skip the markdown update silently. Bd labels are enough.
6. **Do not touch contexts or summaries.** They're historical snapshots. A ref added later doesn't belong in a record of the past.
7. **Report** one line per label applied, then one line per file modified: `Linked bd-le4 to jira:ZAP-50, priority-high — plan updated.`

## Rules

- **Labels are case-sensitive** — treat `jira:ZAP-50` and `JIRA:zap-50` as different. Preserve the user's casing.
- **Idempotent.** Running the skill twice with the same args is safe — no duplicate labels, no duplicate wikilinks, no duplicate entries in `external:`.
- **Never remove labels.** Removal is a separate concern; use `bd label remove <id> <label>` and hand-edit the plan if you need to prune.
- **Never touch contexts or summaries.** Historical artifacts stay as written.
- **Preserve all other frontmatter.** When editing the plan's frontmatter, only touch `external:`. Every other key — `bd:`, `title:`, `created:`, `aliases:`, `tags:`, `private:`, `status:`, `sessions:`, anything user-added — must round-trip untouched.
- **Don't invent external systems.** The namespace prefix (`jira`, `linear`, `gh`, `figma`, etc.) is whatever the user provides. Don't try to normalize or autocorrect.
- **Plan missing is fine.** If a bd has no plan, this skill only updates bd labels. Don't create a plan just to link a ref.

## Wikilink derivation

For the `## Related` section in the plan body:

- `jira:ZAP-50` → `[[ZAP-50]]`
- `linear:FOO-123` → `[[FOO-123]]`
- `gh:listscrub/platform#412` → `[[listscrub#412]]` (use repo name + issue number)
- `figma:<long-id>` → `[[figma/<long-id>]]` (use namespace path form for things without a short human name)
- Anything ambiguous → use the full label verbatim: `[[<namespace>:<id>]]`

## Process

1. Parse bd-id and labels from `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. `bd show <bd-id>` to validate the issue exists and to get the current label set.
3. For each label: `bd label add <bd-id> <label>` unless already present.
4. For namespaced refs, locate the plan at `$AGENT_HOME/plan/<bd-id>-*.md`. If present:
   a. Read frontmatter; add refs to `external:` (create list, dedupe).
   b. Ensure `## Related` section exists in the body; add a wikilink per ref (dedupe).
   c. Write the file.
5. Print the one-line report.
