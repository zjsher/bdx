name: attach
description: >-
  Resume an existing bd-tracked task: load its plan + prior contexts/summaries, append the current harness-qualified session identity to the plan's `sessions:`, and flip bd status to in_progress. Use at the start of a session that's continuing prior work — especially if the prior session was dumped/closed cold and you need state loaded fresh. Skip for ad-hoc bd updates (a bare `bd update --status in_progress` is enough) or for starting brand-new work (use plan instead). Predecessor: plan or scope. Successor: dump (mid-session save) or summarize (when work ships).

Tap the current session into an existing bd-tracked task so the agent picks up cold with full task state — plan, prior comments, prior context dumps, prior summaries — and the bd issue moves to in_progress. The counterpart to `plan` / `scope` (which create the task) and `dump` (which records mid-session head-state for a future attach to load).

**Trigger**: starting a session that's continuing prior work tracked in bd. **Skip** if (a) you only need a status flip — a bare `bd update <id> --status in_progress` is lighter, or (b) you're starting brand-new work — use `plan` to open the task first.

## What this skill does (in order)

1. Resolve the bd-id from `$ARGUMENTS`. If missing, ask the user — do not guess.
2. **Load task state** (read-only first). **Batch these six operations in a single tool-call message — they're independent and sequential execution wastes roundtrips:**
   - `bd show <bd-id>` — issue details, description, labels, status, blockers
   - `bd comments <bd-id>` — all prior comments (these contain links to summaries/contexts from summarize / dump)
   - Find the plan: `ls $AGENT_HOME/plan/<bd-id>-*.md` (typically one match)
   - Find prior context dumps: `grep -l "^bd: <bd-id>$" "$AGENT_HOME/context"/*.md 2>/dev/null`
   - Find prior summaries: `grep -l "^bd: <bd-id>$" "$AGENT_HOME/summary"/*.md 2>/dev/null`
   - Read `$AGENT_HOME/manifest.md`

   Then (once the first batch returns) batch a second round:
   - Read the plan file end-to-end
   - Read the most recent context dump (if any) end-to-end
   - Skim summaries

   **Look up the project** in the manifest using the project label from `bd show` — pull `path`, `type`, and `notes` for the briefing. If the project isn't in the manifest, flag it.
3. **Attach the session** (mutate):
   - Resolve the harness-qualified bdx session identity: prefer `$BDX_SESSION_ID`; otherwise use the exact `bdx-session-id` value injected by SessionStart; otherwise prefix a non-empty `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` as `claude-code:<id>`.
   - If an identity is available, open the plan file's frontmatter `sessions:` list and append it as a quoted string unless it is already present. If the list doesn't exist, create it. If no identity is available, skip silently — do not fail.
4. **Update bd status**: if the issue is `open`, run `bd update <bd-id> --status in_progress`. If already `in_progress`, `blocked`, `deferred`, or `closed`, leave it alone. If `closed`, warn the user and ask whether to `bd reopen` before continuing.
5. **Brief the user**: print a concise summary covering:
   - Project blurb from the manifest (path + 1-line description) — so you remember what this project is
   - Title, status, priority, labels
   - Plan path + 3–5 line overview of the goal/scope (not the full plan)
   - Last 2–3 bd comments (newest first)
   - Paths to the most recent context dump and summary if they exist
   - Next uncompleted checkbox from the plan, if applicable ("Pick up at: <step>")
6. Report one line: `Attached to <bd-id> (<title>) — plan: <path>`.

## Rules

- **Read before mutate.** Step 2 is entirely read-only so the user sees state before anything changes. Only step 3 writes.
- **Don't re-plan.** If the plan feels stale or wrong, do NOT overwrite it — flag it to the user and let them decide whether to `plan` a new task or edit the existing plan manually. Plans are append-only in spirit.
- **Don't dump context here.** attach only reads. Use `dump` separately if you want to snapshot current state before continuing.
- **Don't close or comment on the bd issue.** Attaching is a load operation, not a status broadcast. The only state change is `open → in_progress`.
- **Ambiguous bd-id**: if the user passed a slug instead of a bd-id, try `bd search "<slug>"` and present matches; don't auto-pick.
- **Preserve all other frontmatter.** When appending to the plan's `sessions:` list, every other key — `bd:`, `title:`, `created:`, `aliases:`, `tags:`, `private:`, `status:`, `external:`, anything user-added — must round-trip untouched.

## Process

1. Resolve bd-id from `$ARGUMENTS`; ask if missing.
2. **Single batched message** — run in parallel: `bd show`, `bd comments`, `ls plan`, `grep contexts`, `grep summaries`, read manifest.
3. **Second batched message** — run in parallel: read plan file, read most recent context, skim summaries.
4. Resolve the bdx session identity using the rule above and append it to the plan's `sessions:` frontmatter if available and not already present.
5. If bd status is `open`, `bd update <bd-id> --status in_progress`. If `closed`, warn + prompt.
6. Print the briefing (title, status, plan overview, recent comments, next step).
7. Report the one-line confirmation.
